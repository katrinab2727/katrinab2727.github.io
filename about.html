            <h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p>As the use and reliance on technology continues to grow, protecting information has become more important than ever. Cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving, and the best way to deal with these risks is to learn how to protect yourself and others.</p>
            <p>I have earned a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/PJ0CMYHQTVAY" target="_blank">Google Cybersecurity Specialization Certificate</a>, where I gained knowledge in securing systems and preventing cyber threats. Additionally, I have competed in picoCTF for two years, honing my skills in cybersecurity challenges and competitions. These experiences have allowed me to stay informed about the latest cybersecurity trends and solutions.</p>
